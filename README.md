This project was put together to generate ideas for possible UX or UI design projects.

Simply having a place to start can be a massive hurdle for creating portfolio projects to practice your craft - step in Like X, For Y.

Taking data from [YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/ratings/technology/popularity/digital-services/all), [National Career Service](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/) and some imagery from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).
Combining popular digital services with a range of job roles/audiences to get the idea ball rolling.

It's like AirBnB... for taxidermists - maybe not an idea to go any further with, but certainly somewhere to start!

## Still to come

There are a whole bunch of updates that I plan on making to this project - which will happen as I learn how to do them all:

- [ ] Link to more information
- [ ] Google Analytics tracking on ideas
- [ ] Create dynamic pages for indivdual ideas
- [ ] Add a 'proper' backend
- [ ] Gatsby or similar?
